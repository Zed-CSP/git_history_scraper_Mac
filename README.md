# git_history_scraper_Mac
Scrape metadata on your linux/mac (unix tStamp) and create commits based on 'mtime' modifications to specific filetypes. Make your Git history reflect the private work you've done. Some lines of work wont allow open sourcing, But with your github being judged by peers, an empty history doesnt mean you arent busy!
